"Hopefully."
"That's really all we can rely on considering the emperor holds so much power, even if the way it was achieved was illegitimate."

"If Cassius still refuses to step down, our options will be very limited, and most probably won't turn out well for me, or anyone here that's not part of the family."
"Still, Cassius is proud, very proud."
"Neferu and Virginia think he'll either step down, or at least accept combat to go out with honor."

"I still haven't been able to comprehend the series of events that had just unfolded."
"All I can piece together was that Alex, for whatever reason, had tipped Cato off as to what we were planning."
"I suppose the cat hadn't expected Cato to use such drastic measures, judging by his reaction, but he'd wanted to put a stop to our plans just the same."
"I don't bother myself with trying to figure out Alex's motives anymore though."
"Instead, I'm left to sit here and wonder if there's anything I can possibly do to get out of this."
"I soon find out that the clicking sound was the door locking."
"I suppose that means Cato is the acting emperor again, with Cassius either incapacitated...or even dead."
"I ask Com about Cassius's health, but he only tells me that that information is not available to him."
"So I wait, sitting on the couch for hours, wondering if the next time the door slides open, it will be my death."
"I need Amicus."
"These thoughts become too much for me and I have to get up to walk around, trying hard not to hyperventilate."
"Maybe Neferu will be able to do something."
"He must have heard about what happened by now...unless Cato did something to him as well."

"I experimentally stick an arm over the railing, then a leg, and before I know it, I'm on the other side of the balcony, the lake sloshing below me."
"I think about what I can do."
"I could swim for the shore, make a run for Adastra City and maybe find someone to help me."
"Maybe one of those contacts that Neferu and Virginia keep talking about."

"I need to get to Amicus."
"I need to tell him what happened and...figure out a way to fall back on our last resort."
"My stomach twists at the idea, but I know that we're out of choices now."
"With that, I look down at the water and let go."
