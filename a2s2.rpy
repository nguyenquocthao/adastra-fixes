"The journey back to Neferu's room is when it all hits me at once, and I have to constantly wipe my eyes in case someone like Alex, Neferu...or Cato comes around the corner and sees me."
"I already desperately miss Amicus, and now that I've just left him, I'm reminded of how alone I feel now that he's not always by my side."
"Next time I visit, I'll bring a bunch of stuff to say, do, and eat."
"I can't imagine the dungeon food is any good."
"Maybe we can find more privacy next time, and we'll be able to plan things out, maybe pass information on to him somehow."

"Nothing seems out of place."
"It's quiet and bright, as it usually is, but that's when I realize where I am."
"There's a door to my left, and I immediately know that's the meditation room."
"I remember then that Cassius mentioned that he wanted to meditate, to talk to the parents."
"Is he in there doing that right now...and is that smell part of it?"
"I'm reminded of the night I first met Amicus, that I'd smelled something like burning rubber in the air."
"This isn't that, but I have to wonder if maybe the...parents emit this odd smell when they arrive?"
"I stand there for a while, listening."
"I don't hear anything, but that smell continues, and I know now that it's definitely coming from that room."
"My eyes are squarely locked on the black panel."
"I want to open it, but I know I can't."
"If Cassius really is in the middle of talking to the parents, I could ruin everything."
"So, I start to turn away, deciding that I'll ask Neferu what might be going on in there."
"But as I do, the door opens, and a cloud of billowing, white smoke comes out."
