"I find that the days are easy to adjust to, and like Alex said, 19 hours in a day isn't all that bad."
"Though the sleeping period is a bit shorter than I'm used to, it's been easier now that I sleep on Amicus's bed."

"He doesn't suggest any more \"outings\" and instead wakes up early to go to meditation before leaving for the city to do various campaigning stuff."
"Amicus doesn't explain exactly what that involves, and he doesn't bring me along."
"I ask why, considering I thought my main job was to accompany him to these things, but he just says he's not doing the stuff that involves me quite yet."
"Instead, my introduction to the people of Adastra is going to be during the first trial."
"He says the reveal will be a lot more impressive that way, and that rumors are already spreading about his new pet."
"That's another thing: my involvement in the trial."
"Apparently, I'm to be his partner in the dance portion, something I have no clue how to do."
"I've been getting more and more worried about it, telling Amicus he actually needs to show me what I'm going to be doing, but he brushes me off, telling me it's no big deal."
"Apparently, the dancing is rather easy, and the main objective is just to show me off."
"Since everyone already knows what Alex is, I should be rather impressive to the officials that will be judging us."
"Amicus is confident that we'll win that portion of the contest easily."
"Still, he promises me at least a few sessions of practice before the actual day of the competition."
"I realize now that that's only three days away, and despite Amicus's constant reassurances, I can feel the stress building."
"I can only trust him that the dance is actually easy and simply an opportunity to show me off."
"Meanwhile, half of my days tend to be empty of things to do."
"I'm left on my own to either hang around in Amicus's room, have conversations with Com about Adastra and its culture, or just try and busy myself with menial work."

"Still, I get a lot of time with him since Cassius is out just as much as Amicus, if not more."
"We go out into the gardens a few times and other times we watch Adastran TV together, sometimes even catching Amicus or Cassius giving speeches to the seemingly endless crowds of wolves."
"The broadcasters seem to like tallying up numbers, and it's clear that Cassius always has an edge."
"Still, from what I've gathered, Amicus has had a bit of surge and manages to at least do better than half Cassius's numbers."
"It's still a little worrying though, but from what I can tell, popularity doesn't factor into the trials."
"When I'm not with Alex, I try to avoid running into any of the others, which is actually pretty easy."
